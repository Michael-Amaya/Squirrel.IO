# CMSC436 Project: Milestone 3

## Milestone 3

### Accomplished

 * You can now like and dislikes posts
 * You can now view your own posts under the profile page
 * Ability to delete your own posts is now implemented


### Design Changes
 * We tried going above and beyond adding the ability to Sign-in with Apple and email, but our Apple sign-in currently does not function properly
	* This is not too important, but we hope to have this extra feature completed around our the time we implement stretch goals.
 * We ended up changing the ellipses to a trash can to delete posts. We figured the ellipses would not be needed after all.
