# CMSC436 Project: Milestone 1

## Milestone 1

### Accomplished

 * Established a landing page 
 	* User will be able to login or create an account
 * Account creation/authentication (Firebase)
 	* Users are able to sign in with their email or through Google
 * Created UI for a single post component
	* Home Tab contains all buttons intended for next and final app
 	* Basic features for Post View
		* Profile picture
		* Name
		* Image box where photos will theoretically be viewed by the user
		* Caption
		* Comment button, like/dislike button, report button
		* Camera button (to upload or use camera)
	* Account view 
 * Account handling (logging in)
 	* Displaying name of user (we can obtain this from the Google account)
 	* The user should be able to log out of their account 


### Not Met

 * Currently our Log Out button doesn't work as intended. We hope to update this soon
	* This will be our next thing to complete before starting our Milestone 2
 * We haven't displayed the users name upon sign-in
	* We have yet to set up Firebase Storage and Firestore to store extra user data
	* This is also something we intend to implement once we start using Storage and Firestore in Milestone 2

### Design Changes
 * We tried going above and beyond adding the ability to Sign-in with Apple and email, but our Apple sign-in currently does not function properly
	* This is not too important, but we hope to have this extra feature completed around our the time we implement stretch goals.
 * We added a starting screen on top of our landing page
