# CMSC436 Project: Milestone 2

## Milestone 2

### Accomplished

 * Now users have the ability to post images
 * Location now working, with each posts showing location or "No Location Available"
 * Main feed working, with newest posts at the top of the feed
 * Completed the stretch goal of Squirrel of the day
 * Have the ability to upvote and downvote posts


### Design Changes
 * We tried going above and beyond adding the ability to Sign-in with Apple and email, but our Apple sign-in currently does not function properly
	* This is not too important, but we hope to have this extra feature completed around our the time we implement stretch goals.
